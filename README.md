# Market-Entry-Analysis-for-ABG-Motors-in-India
### Market Entry Analysisfor ABG Motorsin India
In this module, you will work on a case study and apply the concepts you learnt till now. You will
learn how real data is manipulated and understand how the data science concepts are applied in
real-life situations.
The case study given in this module is related to the automotive manufacturing sector. You have to
assist a company to decide whether or not to enter the Indian market; this is done by analysing
sample data over two major cities to understand the sales pattern. This will help you understand how
data-driven decision-making can help you expand sales and achieve a minimum amount of revenue
from the operations in the new country.
Business Understanding
This project is based on an example of ABG Motors, a successful Japanese car manufacturer,
considering entry into the Indian market,seeks to confirm profitability similarities with Japan.
The company sees India as a key opportunity to expand its sales; it has been tracking the Indian
market for over a few years. ABG Motors believes that the Indian market is quite similar to the
Japanese market where the company currently operates. Before entering the new market, the
company wants to be sure that the whole process will be profitable for them. Hence, you are given
the task of ensuring the forecast of a minimum of 12,000 car sells over the sample data in one year.
Since you can’t analyse the entire Indian and Chinese markets, the company has asked you to analyse
sample data from two major cities, one from each country, to understand the sales pattern; which
can be named as “Indian Dataset” & “Japanese Dataset”. Here are they:
### Indian Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12m9_6oDQaI7MB5_-i7a5b2U43JuME2Jc/edit#gid%3D790300961
### Japanese Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UYzm_sF3feszg0GCDoQp-1ruDfa5anoT/edit#gid%3D66633843
### The following results are expected at the end :
1. A classification model over the Japanese data set estimates if an individual is likely to buy a
new phone based on the provided attributes.
2. Based on the learning in the module, justification should be provided for all the decisions
made while building the model.
3. Businessinterpretation of the coefficients obtained for variablesin the model.
4. Metrics associated with the validation, performance, and evaluation of the model
5. Count of potential customers in the Indian market based on the model
6. Also,show some visualisation using Tableau to understand both country’s market trends
